== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why is important to backup my website? =
The majority of people value their digital content, but are still not backing it up regularly. 
More than 50% of adults, personally have and/or know someone who has lost files.
The fact is that, even though today's technology is extraordinarily advanced and 
dependable, it can still fall subject to failure. So unless you have a routine backup 
solution, you're at risk of losing all of your data at a moment's notice.

= How often should a backup be created? =
It depends on how often data gets updated on your website. Maybe daily backups 
are not necessary and maybe monthly backups are not good enough, so the best 
way is measuring the amount of data that gets changed in your particular case.

= What are the minimum requirements for installing WP Easy full backup? =
Your hosting/server must have installed PHP 5.3 or higher with zlib library enabled.
